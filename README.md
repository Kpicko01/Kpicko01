- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kpicko01
- 👀 I’m interested in all things tech, currently trying to transition into software development. My background is in Chemical Engineering but I have always had a strong affinity for software and its versatility.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Python, HTML/Java/CSS. I've been taking classes for about 2 months now. Mostly through Udemy, SoloLearn, and a few apps that give guides and sample problems. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can help me gain experience and grow as a developer
- 📫 How to reach me -- by email kpicko01@gmail.com
